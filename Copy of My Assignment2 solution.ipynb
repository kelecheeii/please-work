A false positive prediction represents the amount of time the predicted value was 'spam' and the actual value was 'not spam', while a false negative prediction represent the amount of time the predicted value was 'not spam' and the true value was 'spam'. i personally think having more false positive predictions in this case is worse, example being, as a student here at the UofC i get a lot of emails concerning school work, a false positive prediction might mean classifying important email correspondeces as 'spam' when it's true value is 'not spam'.\n","\n","3.
